## 🔍 About Me

I’m a data analyst focused on **supply chain, logistics, and business analytics**, with a strong foundation in computer science. I work at the intersection of **data, operations, and decision-making**, helping teams answer not just *what happened*, but *why it happened* and *what actions to take next*.

I specialize in transforming **raw, multi-table datasets** into **analytics-ready data models**, defining **clear and reliable KPIs**, and communicating insights through **dashboards and concise business narratives**. My work emphasizes delivery performance, demand behavior, customer experience, and operational efficiency.

My technical background allows me to ensure insights are **accurate, scalable, and trustworthy**. I focus heavily on data quality, metric definitions, and validation so stakeholders can confidently use the numbers to drive decisions—not just view charts.
